## Beginner - Atbash Cipher
__Source__: http://ow.ly/Z8rOO

#### Background

Atbash is a simple substitution cipher originally for the Hebrew alphabet, but
possible with any known alphabet. It emerged around 500-600 BCE. It works by
substituting the first letter of an alphabet for the last letter, the second
letter for the second to last and so on, effectively reversing the alphabet.
Here is the Atbash substitution table:

```
Plain:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Cipher: ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA
```

#### Input

For this challenge you'll be asked to implement the Atbash cipher and encode
(or decode) some English language words. If the character is NOT part of the
English alphabet (a-z), you can keep the symbol intact. Examples:
```
foobar
wizard
/r/dailyprogrammer
gsrh rh zm vcznkov lu gsv zgyzhs xrksvi
```

#### Output

Your program should emit the following strings as ciphertext or plaintext:
```
ullyzi
draziw
/i/wzrobkiltiznnvi
this is an example of the atbash cipher
```
