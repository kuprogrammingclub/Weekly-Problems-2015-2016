## Intermediate 1 - Hacking a Search Engine
__Source__: http://ow.ly/Z8rU4

Let's consider a simple search engine: one that searches over a large list of
short, pithy sayings. It can take a 5+ letter string as an input, and it returns
any sayings that contain that sequence (ignoring whitespace and punctuation). For example:

```
Search: jacka
Matches: Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water.
         All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
         The Manchester United Junior Athletic Club (MUJAC) karate team was
         super good at kicking.
```
```
Search: layma
Matches: All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
         The MUJAC playmaker actually kinda sucked at karate.
```

Typically, a search engine does not provide an easy way to simply search
"everything", especially if it is a private service. Having people get access to
all your data generally devalues the usefulness of only showing small bits of it
(as a search engine does).

We are going to force this (hypothetical) search engine to give us all of its
results, by coming up with just the right inputs such that every one of its
sayings is output at least once by all those searches. We will also be minimizing
the number of searches we do, so we don't "overload" the search engine.

This is a hard problem in a class of problems that is generally known to computer
scientists to be difficult to find efficient solutions to. I picked a "5+ letter"
limit on the outputs since it makes brute-forcing hard: 265 = 11,881,376 different
combinations, checked against 3,877 lines each is 46 billion comparisons. That
serves as a very big challenge. If you would like to make it easier while
developing, you could turn the 5 character limit down to fewer -- reducing the
number of possible outputs. Good luck!


#### Description

The input will be a (possibly very long) list of short sayings, one per line.
Each has at least 5 letters.
The output must be a list of 5+ letter search queries. Each saying in the input
must match at least one of the output queries. Minimize the number of queries
you output.

#### Input

```
Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water.
All work and no play makes Jack and Jill a dull couple.
The Manchester United Junior Athletic Club (MUJAC) karate team was super good
at kicking.
The MUJAC playmaker actually kinda sucked at karate.
```

#### Output

```
layma
jacka
```
There are multiple possible valid outputs. For example, this is another solution:
```
djill
mujac
```
Also, while this is technically a valid solution, it is not an optimal one,
since it does not have the minimum possible (in this case, 2) search queries:
```
jacka
allwo
thema
themu
```
