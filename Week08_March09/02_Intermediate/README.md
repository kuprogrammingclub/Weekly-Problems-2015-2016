## Intermediate - Ambiguous Bases
__Source__: http://ow.ly/Z8rRV

Due to an unfortunate compression error your lucky number in base n was
compressed to a simple string where the conversion to decimal has potentially
many values.

Normal base n numbers are strings of characters, where each character represents
a value from 0 to (n-1) inclusive. The numbers we are dealing with here can only
use digits though, so some "digits" span multiple characters, causing ambiguity.
For example "A1" in normal hexadecimal would in our case be "101" as "A" converts
to 10, as "A" is the 10th character in base 16
"101" is can have multiple results when you convert from ambiguous base 16 to
decimal as it could take on the possible values:

```
1*16^2 + 0*16^1 + 1*16^0  (dividing the digits as [1][0][1])
10*16^1 + 1*16^0 (dividing the digits as [10][1])
```

A few notes:
- Digits in an "ambiguous" number won't start with a 0. For example, dividing the
  digits in 101 as [1][01] is not valid because 01 is not a valid digit.
- Ensure that your solutions work with non-ambiguous bases, like "1010" base 2
  -> 10
- Recall that like normal base n numbers the range of values to multiply by a
  power of n is 0 to (n-1) inclusive.
